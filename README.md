# DnumFramework
The Dnum Framework is a simple framework made by Maploop which contains a lot of libraries for spigot 1.8.8 plugins.
This framework contians a lot of nice things that you can use without having to code them! Some of them were taken from
other libraries, there is already credit for those people in the classes!

## How to use:
You will first need to clone the repository, how to do that is pretty easy using IntelliJ IDEA's built in
version control system. Follow these steps:

### 1. Click `Use this template`.

### 2. Create a brand new repository for your project.

### 3. Create a new project in IntelliJ and select `Project from Version Control`.

### 4. Click the big green button named Code just above the src of the repository and copy the link you see. (Doesn't matter which type you use, it could be HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI.)

### 5. After you copied it, you need to open your IntelliJ IDEA and paste the link into the textbox you see on Screen.

### 6. Name the project whatever you want your plugin to be named.

### 7. You're done! Now you can refactor the class names how ever much you want!

# Examples and tutorials
There are already examples available in the plugin itself, you can click on the classes to check them out.


### Enjoy using the framework I guess :)
